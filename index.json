Based on this work I published two papers in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national conferences. Back to top\nI was very grateful to receive a sabbatical during the academic year 2020-21. I enjoyed the break from teaching and the chance to engage in some very interesting applied research with excellent collaborators from around the country. My primary sabbatical research project was a major collaboration with Dr. Tricia Miller, Dr. Adam Duerr, and Missy Braham of Conservation Science Global; and Dr. Todd Katzner and Manuela Huso of U.S. Geological Survey. Over the last several years my collaborators had collected a large data set containing millions of GPS locations from 79 Bald Eagles, 30 free-flying birds captured in winter, 5 from rehabilitation facilities, and 44 tagged as nestlings. The resulting data are measured on very short intervals, as little as every 5 seconds, resulting in millions of geospatial and biological measurements. The below photos shows the same 7-week old bald eagle from above, after the telemetry device was attached and a close-up of the device.\nThe richness and extent of the data collected by these devices call for an automated process to classify and interpret the animal movement data. A defining feature of many previous methods developed for interpreting animal movement is that they were initially illustrated with telemetry data collected at relatively long time intervals. My role in this research was to apply statistical methods to that could be used to automate classifying risk to eagles from wind turbines using short-interval GPS telemetry data. To support my research efforts during sabbatical, Dr. Miller and I submitted a grant proposal to the American Eagle Foundation for $19,950.27. This was primarily to make up some of the income lost due to taking a sabbatical for an entire year. The grant was fully awarded.\nGrant application packet\nGrant award\nThe first part of my sabbatical research involved applying a framework for using K-means clustering to classify bird behavior using points from short time interval GPS tracks. My efforts on this part of the research resulted in an article on which I am first-author in Ecology and Evolution.\nBergen, S., Huso, M. M., Duerr, A. E., Braham, M. A., Katzner, T. E., Schmuecker, S., \u0026amp; Miller, T. A. (2022). Classifying behavior from short-interval biologging data: An example with GPS tracking of birds. Ecology and Evolution, 12, e08395. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8395 The next step in my work involved classifying behavior using environmental features. The behaviors we were interested in classifying corresponded to different levels of risk from wind turbines. To carry out the classification I used boosted classification trees (BCTs) as implemented in the open source XGBoost package. XGBoost is a “big data” analysis tool that is computationally feasible even with billions of data observations, affording users a scalable and efficient implementation of BCTs with dramatic implications for model training. In this part of my research I applied BCT modeling with XGBoost to predict three categories of risk of bald eagle colliding with wind turbines in Iowa, and compared its predictive performance and computational time to other supervised learning methods.\nI am the lead author on a second article summarizing this work in the highly-touted Methods in Ecology and Evolution.\nBergen, S., Huso, M.

Back to top\nDuring Fall 2020 I sat in on Dr. Todd Iverson’s course DSCI 330: Management of Unstructured Data. This course was taught entirely with the Python language, which gave me the chance to gain experience with this language. I grew a special appreciation for Python’s capability of managing strings. Below is a screenshot of one of my “homework” assignments:\nI took the WeTeach course for effective online course design. Back to top\nI have taught online multiple times and wanted to learn more about effective online course design, especially given the growth of online teaching especially amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end I completed the WeTeach course for effective online/blended course design and delivery in Summer 2020.\nOne of the best takeaways from this class for me was to create a discussion board for students to introduce themselves at the beginning of the semester. I have done this in all my online offerings since taking WeTeach. I think students appreciate this chance to get to know one another, as it helps reduce the isolation that can be an issue in online courses. It also gives students a way to find people to work with in homework groups if they do not already know someone in the course.\nI read several books and online resources on data visualization design and best practices. Back to top\nI have explored many resources in preparation for teaching DSCI 310: Data visualization. As described in Criterion 1, I wanted to remake the way I taught DSCI 310 by focusing more on the concepts of quality data visualization. This included expanding my treatment of visual perception and designing for aesthetics and accessibility. The following books and online resources have proved hugely instrumental to my course design and thinking on data visualization in general and DSCI 310 specifically:\nShow me the Numbers by Stephen Few\nStorytelling with Data by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic\nStorytelling with Data: Let’s practice! By Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic\nThe Truthful Art by Alberto Cairo\nThe Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson\n#MakeoverMonday by Andy Kriebel and Eva Murray\nI sought out professional data visualizations as inspiration for DSCI 310 assignments. Back to top\nOne way students improve as data visualizers is working to visualize a data set, then seeing a very high quality visual perspective on the same data. To that end, most of the design tasks I set my students in the data visualization course have a published visualization as its inspiration, which I show students after they have submitted their final drafts. Some examples are below.\nDesign task 1: visualizing Brain Drain Source: Washington Post Design task 4: minimum wage and cost of living Source: Flowing Data ","date":1703203200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703203200,"objectID":"0c08381a2744dac5854f76d5a38fae60","permalink":"https://silasbergen.github.io/full_promotion/narratives/crit3/","publishdate":"2023-12-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/full_promotion/narratives/crit3/","section":"narratives","summary":"During my time as Associate Professor, I demonstrated continuing preparation in the following ways:\nI took a class on the Python programming language.\nI took the WeTeach course for effective online course design.","tags":null,"title":"Criterion 3: Continuing preparation","type":"narratives"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rEnd-of-year senior celebration at Island City Brewing Co, May 2023 During my time as Associate Professor, I contributed to student growth and development in the following ways:\nI supervised student capstones and internships.\nI wrote student letters of recommendation.\nI served on a student Master’s committee.\nI was invited to and participated in a student-led panel on healthy masculinity.\nI led students on professional development trips.\nFor additional evidence of my support of student growth and development, please see notes of thanks from graduates\nI advised student capstones and internships.

Back to top\nI did some consulting work for Will Varela, a master’s student in the biology department. This work centered on analyzing quality of the Whitewater river using biotic data on fish and invertebrates as well as stream characteristics such as temperature and quality of substrates on the river bed. Below are some of the plots I provided him to demonstrate different levels of quality (as represented by the three clusters; poor, moderate, and good) and their spatial distribution across three branches of the Whitewater River.\nI was subsequently invited to serve on his Master’s thesis committee, to which I agreed. I participated in thesis draft review and sat in on his thesis defense.\nI was invited to and participated in a student-led panel on healthy masculinity. Back to top\nIn Fall 2019 a former STAT 110 student invited me to participate in a panel on healthy masculinity. The panel was hosted by the RE Initiative. I along with six other university faculty/staff/students responded to several questions posed by the RE Initiative student leaders. It was a valuable experience and I was honored to be invited and participate.\nHealthy masculinity panel I led students on professional development trips. Back to top\nWhile traveling was paused for a couple years during COVID, it picked up a bit in the last couple years which was a welcome change. In September 2022, Dr. Chris Malone and I took students to a Twin Cities ASA chapter event Navigating difficult conversations with statistical collaborators. Many of the students who came were in my statistical consulting class, and enjoyed a rich and interactive conversation regarding potentially difficult communications with clients and collaborators.\nThe group at Twin Cities ASA event, September 2022 Data analytics competitions, an invaluable learning experience for students, also took a pause with COVID but returned in Spring 2023 with a collaboration with the Minnesota Twins. MinneMUDAC brought in dozens of teams to analyze ticket sales data at Target Field with the goal of understanding factors that related to and predicting upcoming season prices.

I inherited a quality curriculum outline with solid content from my colleague Dr. Todd Iverson. One area where I saw room for improvement was with in-class activities and class projects.\nActivities Building upon Dr. Iverson’s content, I developed a suite of near-daily activities to illustrate many of the concepts he had brought into the course. Many of these activities drew from data brought to the Statistical Consulting Center, which I had been directing for a couple years. Here are some examples.\nActivity Example 1: WSU vehicle requests The screenshot below shows data on requests for WSU vehicles:\n{width=“6.5in” height=“3.0868055555555554in”}\nSome of the tasks students had to do:\nClean “Destination City,” which was very messy as requesting parties could just type in their destination resulting in many variants of the same place (e.g. St. Paul; St paul; st paul; ST Paul St Paul/MPLS).\nPull off number of passengers, which is embedded in the Vehicle(s) field.\nCompute average trip length for each vehicle, which requires differencing Departure from Return.\nFind number of vehicles used for each trip, which required splitting the Vehicle(s) column when it contained multiple vehicles.\nActivity Example 2: trout spawning data The data below came from a consulting client, measuring redds (spawning nests) of stream trout.\nFrom a data science perspective, there are many issues with this data that students had to grapple with including:\nHighlighting indicating grouping status;\nDifferent sections of streams contained in different spreadsheets;\nBold lines indicating 1000-yard segments;\nOne separate Excel file for each of 4 different years.\nActivity Example 3: rape myth agreement This data set also came from a consulting client working on a counsellor’s education master’s thesis. She wanted to compare rape myth belief as measured by the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale before and after a training on gender-based violence among student athletes. The raw data and the clean data are shown below:\nStudents needed to recode all of the Likert-scale items to come up with a single score for each student, then match the scores on the pre- and post-training data to develop the clean data set on the right.\nProjects Along with the in-class activities, I developed several in-class projects that required substantial application of the DSCI 210 content.\nProject example 1: COVID-19 trends This project required students to pull data from a Github repository, clean it, and visualize it. This was a final project which required a substantial amount of coding, cleaning, and visualizing with R:\nProject example 2: MUDAC 2020 This final project build on MUDAC 2020, which focused on understanding whether various motions made during civil rights trials could predict the outcome of the trial. Some of the questions students had to answer with this data involved whether filing rates differed by district, and how the prevalence and frequency of motions impacted likelihood of cases being settled or taken to trial. Students had to use association rules, a recently learned technique, to analyze the former.\nFeedback Student feedback on the activities and project was very positive.

You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python\rimport pandas as pd\rdata = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;)\rdata.head()\r```\rrenders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;}\r- Hugo Modules\r- wowchemy\r- blox-plugins-netlify\r- blox-plugins-netlify-cms\r- blox-plugins-reveal\r```\rrenders as\n- Hugo Modules\r- wowchemy\r- blox-plugins-netlify\r- blox-plugins-netlify-cms\r- blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap\r- Mindmaps\r- Links\r- [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/)\r- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb)\r- [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder)\r- Features\r- Markdown formatting\r- **inline** ~~text~~ *styles*\r- multiline\rtext\r- `inline code`\r-\r```js\rconsole.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;);\rconsole.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;);\r```\r- Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$\r```\rrenders as\n- Mindmaps\r- Links\r- [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/)\r- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb)\r- [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder)\r- Features\r- Markdown formatting\r- **inline** ~~text~~ *styles*\r- multiline\rtext\r- `inline code`\r-\r```js\rconsole.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;);\rconsole.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;);\r```\r- Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$\rExample inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\rf(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\r1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}\r$$\rDiagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid\rgraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]\r```\rrenders as\ngraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid\rsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!\r```\rrenders as\nsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!
